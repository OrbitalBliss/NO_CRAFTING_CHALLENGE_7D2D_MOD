No Crafting Challenge Mod -- for 7 Days to Die [Alpha 17.3]
------------------------------------------------
V1.1 by OrbitalBliss

Welcome to the No Crafting Challenge Mod.  
This Mod removes all crafting, and gives a slight bump to the Loot in regards to Food, Drink, and Medical Supplies.  
The Trader gets a boost in those things as well, and can sell bedrolls.  
Vehicles can show up at traders, but only poor quality Bicycles unless your Bartering is high enough.  
Snowberries and Supercorn very rarely become options for farming.  
And a number of small fixes (I borrowed from my Home Depot Mod).  

This mod is intended to be played with all setting set to default, but you do you.

I hope this fills out your players gaming experiences.  Have fun!!
