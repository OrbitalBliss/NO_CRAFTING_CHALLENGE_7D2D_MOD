No Crafting Challenge Mod -- for 7 Days to Die [Alpha 17.3]
------------------------------------------------
V1.2 by OrbitalBliss

Welcome to the No Crafting Challenge Mod.  
This Mod removes all crafting... ALL crafting.  
It also gives a slight bump to the Loot in regards to Food, Drink, and Medical Supplies, plus a few additions.  
The Trader gets a boost in those things as well, and can sell a few things he previously did not.
Some of these additions are far less common than others, or require higher Barter (like Vehicles).  
And a number of small fixes (I borrowed from my Home Depot Mod).  

This mod is designed to be installed on a fresh game, but should work when added to an ongoing game.
This mod is intended to be played with all setting set to default, but you do you.

I hope this fills out your players gaming experiences.  Have fun!!

Removed ALL Recipes (and fixed resulting issues; broken scrapping and weapon/armor mod values, etc)

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------------------
Simply download the No_Crafting_Challenge_Mod_v1.0.zip file (or whatever the current release is).  
Do NOT just click "Clone or download" or you'll be downloading stuff you don't want/need.  
Decompress this ZIP directly into your 7 Days to Die install directory.  
If you didn't have a "Mods" folder, this will create one.  
You should be ready to go.  

PLEASE ... Always backup your save folder if you are adding mods to pre-existing games.
