No Crafting Challenge Mod -- for 7 Days to Die [Alpha 17.2]
------------------------------------------------
V1.0 by OrbitalBliss

Welcome to the No Crafting Challenge Mod.  
This Mod removes all crafting, and gives a slight bump to the Loot in regards to Food, Drink, and Medical Supplies.  
The Trader gets a boost in those things as well, and can sell bedrolls.  
Vehicles can show up at traders, but only poor quality Bicycles unless your Bartering is high enough.  
Snowberries and Supercorn very rarely become options for farming.  
And a number of small fixes (I borrowed from my Home Depot Mod).  

This mod is intended to be played with all setting set to default, but you do you.

I hope this fills out your players gaming experiences.  Have fun!!

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------------------
Simply download the No_Crafting_Challenge_Mod_v1.0.zip file (or whatever the current release is).
Do NOT just click "Clone or download" or you'll be downloading stuff you don't want/need.
Decompress this ZIP directly into your 7 Days to Die install directory.  If you didn't have a "Mods" folder, this will create one.  You should be ready to do.  Type 'Home' into your crafting search bar to see most of the things added.
